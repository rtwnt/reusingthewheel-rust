I haven't posted here in a long time, although I've been making some changes to this blog behind the scenes. One of the more recent (and more permanent) ones is switching to a different theme - this time it's a customized version of [Hyde][1]. Another big and permanent change is switching to a custom hosting and a custom domain - from now on, this blog will be available on [reusingthewheel.net][2].

[piotr-rusin.github.io][3] will still be up for a while, but probably not for long.
