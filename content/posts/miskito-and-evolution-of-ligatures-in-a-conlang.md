I've recently read about [Miskito language][1] of Central America, and one of its features inspired me to include similar features and their evolution in some of my conlangs.

**DISCLAIMER:** *I'm not a professional linguist and I have not studied linguistics. The following article presents a mixture of linguistic knowledge (as I remember or understand it) I accquired from various sources and of my own speculative ideas. It's enough for my needs regarding creation of "naturalistic" artificial languages, but I probably shouldn't be cited in any "serious" context.*

## Ligature (or ezāfe) in Miskito and other languages

In short, ligatures/linkers/ezāfe are particles, clitics or suffixes used to connect nouns and their modifiers. They occur in Persian (and related languages), Albanian, Austronesian and some other languages.

Examples of ligatures (not all inflections are always included in the gloss, but the relevant ones are). Miskito example comes from [this article about Miskito language][1], while other examples come from [this article about ezāfe][2]

Persian:

```text
Possessive:
barādar-e   Maryam
brother-LIG Maryam
Maryam's brother

Adjective:
barādar-e   bozorg
brother-LIG big
the big brother
```

Albanian:

```text
Possesion:
Zyra    e   Shefit
office  LIG boss
the boss's office

Adjective:
Në një      zyrë    të  afërt
in INDEF    office  LIG adjacent
In an adjacent office
```

Miskito:

```text
Determiner:
baha aras-ka
DEM.DISTAL horse-LIG
that horse

Adjective:
aras-ka karna-ba
horse-LIG strong-DEF
the strong horse

Possessive:
Juan aras-ka
Juan horse-LIG
Juan's horse

Relative clasues:
María atkan aras-ka ba
María buy horse-LIG DEF
The horse that María bought
```

Why do I think using ligatures in some of my languages would be interesting? It is a piece of nominal morphology that adds complexity to nouns, but is still different from the nominal complexity of some Indo-European languages. Also, just like case inflections, remnants of ligatures (or ligature-free forms of nouns) may be preserved in certain derivational and inflectional affixes in daughter languages.

## Diachronic source of phrase-internal and phrase-final ligature

Ligatures in Iranian evolved from relative clauses, and some languages employing ligatures today use them in their relative clause (or in some cases, even possessive) constructions - as shown in [this article about differentiation between genitives, adjectives and relative clauses on WALS][3], so I think it's a good way to have it evolve in my language family, too - especially considering such constructions are attested among various unrelated languages and language families.

In my language family, the relativizer could be originally uninflected, or it could be a pronoun agreeing in case, number and gender with the head noun (just like ligature in Albanian language still does), so that the resulting linker could (at least in some branches of the language family) preserve those categories:

```text
NOUN, REL-SG/PL ADJECTIVE -> NOUN=LIG.SG/PL ADJECTIVE
```

Phrase-final ligature, like the one occuring in Miskito language, could evolve from phrase-internal ligature by switching order of nouns and modifiers in noun phrase (`NOUN=LIG ADJECTIVE -> ADJECTIVE NOUN=LIG`, for example), possibly due to influence of languages in which the order of elements of a noun phrase is different. Different branches of the language family I'm going to create could also preserve the old order for some classes of modifiers, like definite articles, some adjectives, quantifiers, etc.

## What about relative clauses with verbs?

I'm not sure yet, but I think it could be possible for the verbal forms in such clauses to be reanalyzed as new deverbal adjectives and have them be affected by the reordering of elements of noun phrase. It could be especially interesting if the adjectives formed this way included formerly verbal inflectional categories that were not expressed in other adjectives before, like tense or subject's grammatical number.

Also, if verbs in relative clauses displayed verbal characteristics, then why wouldn't it be the case also with adjectives? They would be more verb-like, sharing at least some inflectional categories with predicative verbs.

## Separate possessed form and its evolution

All of the languages, for which I included examples of their ligatures, use them also for forming possessive constructions. It reminds me of [construct state][4] - a form occuring in some Semitic and Other Afro-Asiatic languages. It's a suffix occuring on the possessed noun in possessive noun phrases - just like ligature is suffixed to a possessed noun in Persian and Miskito. I've also read about similar expressions of possessive marking in other languages (for example, [at least some Cariban languages][6]).

Would it be naturalistic for my language to have two separate ligature suffixes - one for combining nouns with adjectives (and, perhaps, verbs), and another one for combining possessed nouns with possessors? I can't recall I have ever read about a language that would have such separate, non-zero ligature markers for those two categories. However:

* I could see how such two seprate markers - a possessive and adjectival ligature - could originate from different sources in one language
* there are languages that express adjectives and relative clauses in one way, while expressing genitives in a different way - and there is more of them than of languages that express all three parts of speech in the same way

So, I think having a language with two ligature-like constructions doesn't seem like too much of a stretch. I could include construct state (or an adposition that would grammaticalize to a construct state suffix) in the proto-language and explore its evolution throughout the whole language family, and have it interact with the ligature in various ways.

```text
cat POSS Ala -> cat=CONSTR Ala
Ala's cat
```

For example: in daughter languages, for some (obligatorily possessed?) nouns construct state (which was much more frequent than the actual ligature with those nouns) may be reinterpreted as a form of ligature for those nouns and extended to constructions involing a modifier that is not a possessor. If the ligature forms originating from the construct state then dissapear (for example: due to sound changes, or due to combination of sound changes and analogical levelling), it could create a situation similar to that of Miskito - obligatorily possessed nouns would not require ligature.

Also, after construct state evolves, the daughter languages that would undergo reordering of noun phrase elements could also undergo such reordering in possessive phrases with construct state:

```text
cat=CONSTR Ala -> Ala cat=CONSTR
```

## What if a noun is modified by both a ligature and a possessor?

Such constructions could express meanings like "the greatest victory of the king" or "the prettiest of our cats". I have to think of how they would be expressed in the proto-language, and how such expressions could evolve in daughter languages.

In any case, the old constructions (or their reflexes) could be replaced in daughter languages by:

* generalizing the adjective ligature to possessors (perhaps with the exception of nouns frequently occuring with possessors, like body parts)
* ommiting ligature in possessive constructions
* perhaps combining the ligature and construct state in ways that first appeared in daughter languages

## Loss of ligatures

If ligature is limited in use to nouns with modifiers other than just definite articles, then I think it should be pretty easy for a language to lose ligature as a productive affix (and preserve it as a linguistic fossil as part of some other forms) even without additional conditions, or to limit its use to certain contexts (like possessive ones). The process of losing productive ligature could be reinforced by ligature being lost for some nouns due to phonetic sound changes, while being preserved with other nouns, or by contact with languages that do not use ligatures.

If originally adding definite article to a noun didn't require adding a ligature and if it was possible that the speaker of a language could reinterpret presence of a definite article as a condition blocking appearance of a ligature (which doesn't have to be the case, as even in the proto language it should be possible to form phrases like "the cat that was pretty"), then gradual grammaticalization of a definite article as a mere nominal marker could also limit the use of ligature more and more.

## Preservation of ligature as a fossil

Nouns that would frequently occur as heads of noun phrases could grammaticalize as derivational affixes, and such affixes could at least initially include reflexes of the ligature or construct state. The formations in which they would be used would include derivations of nouns naming people or groups of people (inhabitants of an area, names of proffessions), grammatical number markers and more.

```text
LOCATION.NAME PERSON=LIG ->
a person from LOCATION.NAME

ACTION.NAME PERSON/FATHER/OWNER=LIG ->
agent noun, a person perforimg a proffession related to ACTION.NAME

NOUN CHILD-LIG/CHILDREN=LIG ->
a diminutive of NOUN

NOUN PEOPLE=LIG -> NOUN=PLURAL
```

Ligature and construct state could also be preserved as suffixes or infixes (depending on the order of elements in a noun phrase in a particular language) in some less regular compounds.

## Making nouns with ligatures default forms (used also without modifiers)

If, like in Miskito language, the original definite article of the proto-language could be used with ligature (with added emphasis), then it is possible for the emphasized definite construction to replace the non-emphasized one, which would make ligature required with definite article. Then, as the definite article further grammaticalizes and extends its range of use, the ligature form associated with it also extends its use, which makes it possible for the ligature form to be preserved as a default form once definite articles undergo semantic bleaching and become obligatory components of nouns.

If definite article was still not suffixed when used with ligatures, then NOUN-LIG DEF phrase could be reorganized into DEF NOUN-LIG, analogically to reorganization of `NOUN=LIG ADJECTIVE` phrases into `ADJECTIVE NOUN=LIG`). This would make it possible for the generalized ligature suffix to avoid fusing with definite article and remain the same both in definite and non-definite contexts.

If a language uses ligatures with demonstrative pronouns and demonstrative pronouns start replacing former definite marking (which didn't have to require ligature), then the result should be the same.

## Preservation of ligature-free forms when nouns with ligature were generalized as default ones

Ligature-free nouns could be preserved as first or second elements of compounds (depending on the order in which noun and its modifier requiring ligature occur) or as adjectives. Also, some nouns that originally didn't accept definite articles (like some proper names or nouns borrowed into the language after definiteness as an inflectional category stopped being productive) could be inherited in their ligature-free forms.
