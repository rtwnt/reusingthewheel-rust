I recently made some progress on Yule &#8211; my Spring Boot-based blog engine project &#8211; and now I have its first working version. The current features, installation, configuration and how to run the engine are all described in the README file in [the repository of the project][1], so I won&#8217;t be covering them here.

My next steps in developing the engine will include:

  * improving the front end
  * refactoring the code by restructuring the configuration and moving repetitive code from controllers into common dependencies (including moving some data-manipulation code to some new service-layer classes).
  * adding more features, like configurable menus and tag system

This is just a short informational post. It&#8217;s been quite a long time since I posted anything here and I wanted to post some information about my progress. Plus, I&#8217;d prefer describing my code, its organization and problems I solved by writing it a certain way once it is at least refactored.

Also, I&#8217;m considering switching to writing more short posts like this and doing it more frequently, instead of posting infrequent, but long articles. I think such shorter, but more single-topic-focused posts might be more interesting to read, plus they might be better for my motivation to write this blog.
