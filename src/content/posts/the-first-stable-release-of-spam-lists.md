I released the first stable version of spam-lists. It can be downloaded from [github][1] or [PyPI][2].

In comparison to the version described in [this post][3], the stable version contains some changes, mostly spelling error corrections and reformatting of docstrings. I have also changed the license of the project from [Apache License 2.0][4] to [MIT][5].
