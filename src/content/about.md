title: About

---
My name is Piotr Rusin. I majored in civil engineering at Poznan University of Technology, but I'm more interested in programming, both as a hobby and as a career choice.

I chose the name "Reusing the wheel" as a reference to two approaches to software development: doing something from scratch ("reinventing the wheel") and reusing existing code. The first is generally discouraged - especially for developing commercial software, although it can be fun and useful as a learning experience when developing personal projects. The second is a common good practice, saving time and effort and allowing a programmer to focus on solving project-specific problems.

The blog has, so far, been about programming. Describing my private projects was its original purpose, but I've been reconsidering it for quite some time (while also having a writers block and not posting anything here, unfortunately). Perhaps some other topics that interest me will appear here, too, especially if they can be connected to IT (like Linux) or to my new and future pet projects (like linguistics).

I hope the blog will be interesting to read. Any comments and suggestions are welcome - I'm always open to learn something new or improve my knowledge. You can send me an email to <contact@reusingthewheel.net>.
